# [Project 1: Multi-Agent Chat Model](https://github.com/usama8199/MultiAgent-ChatModel/tree/main)
#### Overview and Video Explanation
- We have created a multi-agent chat model that allows you to perform various tasks, such as sending emails to people or browsing the web
- We have utilized Langchain and Langgraph, which extends the LangChain Expression Language with the ability to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic manner
- A supervisor will understand the task and utilize one or more agents, depending on whether they can answer or solve the desired task
- Once an agent completes its task, it will provide the result to the supervisor, deciding whether the task is completed or if another tool is required. Regardless of the situation, the chain will come back to the supervisor
